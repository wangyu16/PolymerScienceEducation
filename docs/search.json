    "text": "Introduction\nThis is a series of Open Virtual Experiment Simulator Education Tools (OVESET) aims at improving inductive reasoning of undergraduate polymer science students. Polymer science education does not only require students to memorize concepts and principles but also requires students to analyze and problem-solve mathematical and logical relationships through inductive reasoning, such as analyzing the relationship between reaction conditions and properties of the resulting polymers and structure-property correlations. These topics involving inductive reasoning are the most challenging; however, current educational resources could not provide students sufficient training on these topics. This project addresses this gap in polymer science education by developing of OVESET and its ancillary materials. The ultimate goal is to improve polymer science instruction by providing the field with state-of-the-art, affordable (free and open) experiment simulators that are sustainable, effective, and easily adaptable (requiring only a web browser for users).\nThis series includes 9 modules which are: Concept of molecular weight distribution; Chain-growth polymerization kinetics; Conventional radical polymerization kinetics; Kinetics of atom transfer radical polymerization; Copolymerization statistics; Network formation; Single chain conformation; Self-avoid chians; Star and branched polymers."

Users just need to click on a link and the simulator will be open in a webpage. Users are required to sign in with their own google accounts. Then simulations can be performed within the webpage and the results are shown in place.\nOne click: Users just need to select or type in the reaction conditions, then choose “Run all” under the tab “Runtime”. The simulations will be trigered and the results will be shown.\nOne minute: The simulations are fast, which usually take seconds to a few minutes to finish.\n\nFor advanced users, the source code can be downloaded from GitHub.
