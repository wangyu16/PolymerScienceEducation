## 2 Module objectives

* Given the reactivity ratio and the monomer feedstock fractions, predict which monomer is being consumed faster and what type of polymers (random, alternating, blocky, etc.) are being produced.
* Caculate F1 knowing f1 and predict if it is possible that f1 equals F1. If f1 equals F1, what is the value?

## 3. Classroom implementation ideas

Perform the following virtual experiments (f1 = 0.5 for all cases) and answer the questions for each simulation.

Experiments:

1. MMA and Styrene (r1 = 0.46, r2 = 0.52)  
2. MA and MMA (r1 = 0.4, r2 = 2.2)  
3. MA and Styrene (r1 = 0.80, r2 = 0.19)  
4. Styrene and Maleic Anhydride (r1 = 0.05, r2 = 0.005)  
5. Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate (r1 = 5.5, r2 = 0.06)  

Questions:

1. Select the correct answer(s).  
A.	When the chain end is M1, it prefers to add to M1.

2. Select the correct answer.  
A.	M1 is consumed faster.

## 4. Example practice questions

1. In a copolymerization of monomers 1 and 2, initially present in the mole ratio
1:1, what is the composition of the copolymer formed initially, if r1 = 0.46 and r2 = 0.52?

B. 0.5  
C. 0.7  
D. 0.8  
E. 0.9
