Like a snake, avoid running into yourself!

## 1. Link to the simulator

## 2 Module objectives

* Compare the root mean square (RMS) end-to-end distances and radii of gyration of polymers with the same degree of polymerization ($DP$) based on hindered rotation model and self-avoid hindered rotation model. 
* Derive the scaling rule between the size of the polymer chain and the degree of polymerization ($DP$) for self-avoid chains given the self-avoid criteria. 
* Explore the influence of self-avoid criteria on the scaling rule. 

## 3. Classroom implementation ideas

Experiments:

Set the self avoid threshold as 1.5 and bond angle as 109.5 $^\circ$, perform simulations with different chain lengths, record the results in the table.

| DP | $h_{nsa}$ | $h_{sa}$ | $R_{g,nsa}$ | $R_{g,sa}$ |
|----|-----|-----|-------|-------|
| 25 |     |     |       |       |
| 50 |     |     |       |       |
| 100 |     |     |       |       |
| 200 |     |     |       |       |
| 400 |     |     |       |       |

The subscript "nsa" means non-self-avoid and "sa" means self-avoid.

Questions:

1. Does the self-avoid chain model have the same scaling factor as non-self-avoid model? What is the scaling factor of the self-avoid chain under the simulation conditions? 

2. Change the self avoid threshold and perform the simulations again. How does the self-avoid threshold influence the scaling factor?

3. Change the bond angles and perform the simulations again. How does the bond angle influence the scaling factor?

## 4. Example practice questions

1. Which of the statement is true?

(a) Given the same $DP$, a self-avoid chain always have larger end-to-end distance than a non-self-avoid chain.
(b) Given the same $DP$, the RMS end-to-end distance of self-avoid chains is larger than that of non-self-avoid chains.
(c) With $DP=50$, the RMS end-to-end distance of self-avoid chains is $a$ times larger than that of non-self-avoid chains; for $DP=500$, the factor $a$ should be the same comparing the RMS end-to-end distance of self-avoid chains and non-self-avoid chains. 
(d) Given the same $DP$, a self-avoid chain always have larger radius of gyration than a non-self-avoid chain.

2. Why self-avoid chain model does not have the same scaling rule as non-self-avoid chain model, i.e., $\langle h\rangle \propto DP^{0.5}$?
